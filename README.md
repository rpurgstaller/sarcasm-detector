# sarcasm-detector

Sarcasm detection analysis using python and scikit learn. 

I used tweepy (https://www.tweepy.org) to create a dataset containing german tweets with the hashtags #sarkasmus (sarcasm) and #ironie (irony). 

For further information please refer to the paper *sarcasm-detection.pdf*.
